# Brandy Old Fashioned Sweet

As a little kid I remember going to Supper Clubs for Friday Fish Fry and my grandmother always ordering a "Brandy Old Fashioned Sweet."  This was to distinguish it from a proper Old Fashioned that is not sweet and also made with Bourbon.  This was a common drink is Wisconsin that is making a comeback.

    2 Oz VSOP Brandy
    1 Oz. Cinnamon Simple Syrup
    1 Slice Orange
    2 Luxardo Cherries
    12 Drops Bitter Cube Jamaican #2 Bitters
    1 Cinnamon Stick
    
Muddle orange and two cherries in the bottom of a Collins Glass.  Fill glass with ice.  Add Brandy and Simple Syrup.  Stir with Bar Spoon.  Garnish with Cinnamon Stick.

## Cinnamon Simple Syrup
    1 Cup Water
    1 Cup Granulated Sugar
    2 Cinnamon Sticks
    
Place all ingredients in a pot and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Cool to room temperature, strain, and refrigerate.
